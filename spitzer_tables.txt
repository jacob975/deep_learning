I browse the spitzer catalogues, and determine whether we should use it or not.


Name                    Used    Note
SEIP                    no      It makes photometry on compact sources only on all Spitzer images.
IRS Enhanced Products   no      It doesn't cover full IRAC
Spitzer Abell 1763      yes     It is galaxy cluster
c2d                     yes     We train our model with c2d data.
CLASH                   no      No MIPS 1 data
CSI 2264                yes     Which is a active star forming region
Cygnus-X                yes     Which is a active star forming region
DUSTiNGS                no      It provide IRAC 1 and IRAC 2 only
FEPS Photometry Catalog yes     The photometry on evolving planetary systems.
GALCEN                  no      No MIPS 1 data
GLIMPSE                 yes     GLIMPSE I, GLIMPSE II, and GLIMPSE 3D only, the other are observed in warm spitzer program, which is not good.
